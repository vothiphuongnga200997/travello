Returning an empty value is fine, but pressing `Cancel` fails the keyword.\n\n`message` is the instruction shown in the dialog and `default_value` is the possible default value shown in the input field.\n\nIf `hidden` is given a true value, the value typed by the user is hidden. `hidden` is considered true if it is a non-empty string not equal to `false`, `none` or `no`, case-insensitively. If it is not a string, its truth value is got directly using same [rules as in Python](http://docs.python.org/2/library/stdtypes.html#truth-value-testing).\n\nExample:\n\n```\n${username} =  Get Value From User  Input user name  default\n${password} =  Get Value From User  Input password  hidden=yes\n```\n\nPossibility to hide the typed in value is new in Robot Framework 2.8.4. Considering strings `false` and `no` to be false is new in RF 2.9 and considering string `none` false is new in RF 3.0.3."
