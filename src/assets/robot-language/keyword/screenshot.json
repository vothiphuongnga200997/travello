If the `name` ends with extension `.jpg` or `.jpeg`, the screenshot will be stored with that exact name. Otherwise a unique name is created by adding an underscore, a running index and an extension to the `name`.\n\nThe name will be interpreted to be relative to the directory where the log file is written. It is also possible to use absolute paths. Using `/` as a path separator works in all operating systems.\n\n`width` specifies the size of the screenshot in the log file.\n\nExamples: (LOGDIR is determined automatically by the library)\n\n```\nTake Screenshot      # LOGDIR/screenshot_1.jpg (index automatically incremented)\nTake Screenshot  mypic    # LOGDIR/mypic_1.jpg (index automatically incremented)\nTake Screenshot  ${TEMPDIR}/mypic    # /tmp/mypic_1.jpg (index automatically incremented)\nTake Screenshot  pic.jpg    # LOGDIR/pic.jpg (always uses this file)\nTake Screenshot  images/login.jpg  80%  # Specify both name and width.\nTake Screenshot  width=550px    # Specify only width.\n```\n\nThe path where the screenshot is saved is returned."
